When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When collaboration from many users are needed, so the files can be accessed from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because you may only want certain commits to be pulled or changed in the
  local repository.
