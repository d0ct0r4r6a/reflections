When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When collaboration from many users are needed, so the files can be accessed from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because you may only want certain commits to be pulled or changed in the
  local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

  forks: Same as git clone but used in GitHub remote repositories.
  clones: Copy repositories from GitHub or other local repository.
  branches: Create different path for future commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can identify what is the last version in the remote repo before any
    future commits are made.
