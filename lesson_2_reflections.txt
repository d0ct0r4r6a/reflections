What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  It creates hidden folders to configure git folder. To let git software
  modifies the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  Staging area does not exist i.e. it is a temporary place for files to be
  stored before committing them. It shorten the duration to commit necessary
  files and to group commits with the same logic change in them.
